## Bug 921765 - Possible New Thimble Project?

> Hi,

> I finally sat down to finish the MozFest demo project I started last year. Yay!

> Not sure how the submission process works so Pomax recommended I submit here.

> Notes:
> - I couldn't find a "make" style guide (only a branding one), so I'm not sure if it fits, but if there is one and someone can point me to it, I'd be happy to adjust the project.
> - I'm in no way a graphics artist or designer, so to get people to use it, I get the sense that it needs to look prettier. If this gets seriously considered as a thimble project, it would be helpful if someone provides some feedback on the looks.

This is a bug I was pulled into (quite happily I should add) so that I might help make some tweaks to the styling.
