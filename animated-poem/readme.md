## Make an Animated Poem
-- By the [National Writing Project](http://www.nwp.org/)

This project needed a little bit of help w/ crossbrowser compatability so I took a quick look at it. For the sake of keeping my changes tracked, and clear I opted to do this project under version control w/ the rest of my makes.

**Bug:** <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=947844>  
**Original Make:** <https://nwp.makes.org/thimble/poetry-180-animate>
