      <h1>Welcome to The web I want... Tutorial!</h1>
      <p>This tutorial is meant to help you with this make, but if at any time you want to hide it, just click on the <span class="arrow">&lt;</span> arrow icon above.</p>
      
      <h2>Prior Knowledge</h2>
      <p>By now you should have the idea of how these work, so this time we're going to be mostly hands off.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>Change that Text</h1>
      <p>Let's start by changing the name of your webpage on line 8. Obviously, optional, but feel free to personalize.</p>
       
      <h2>What web do you want?</h2>
      <p>Head down to line 74 to tell us.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h1>A Little About Yourself</h1>
      <p>Change the name on line 77. You are not the person you remixed this from!</p>
      <p>Don't forget to update the link to use your persona username.</p>
      <p>On line 76, tell us where you're from. Zorg is not a real place =P</p>
      
      <h2>Add Your Avatar</h2>
      <p>Change the link on line 79 to link to your avatar and it will automagically be cropped with a border added.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h1>Change the Background</h1>
      <p>You can change the background to something that you like by replacing the link on line 17.</p>
            
      <h2>Bonus Styling</h2>
      <p>Know CSS? Play around with the other colours, and the text.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h1>Congratulations!</h1>
      <p>You've just shared your thoughts with the world!</p>
      <p>Don't forget to hit the save button and share it with others you know.</p>
      <p>We hope you've had fun with this make, but if something is missing or unclear, <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/new/webmaker">let us know</a>!</p>
