Welcome to the Hackable Facilitation Guide!

Use this template to write out an agenda for your Webmaker session and get tips on the hows and whys of group facilitation. Use the Hacking Guides for ideas on activities to run, or create your own Kit: https://mozteach.makes.org/thimble/hackable-make-a-kit-template

This page requires a unique blend of HTML agility, CSS wizardry and mental firepower. There are people who are on the web, and then there are people who MAKE the web. Your goal in this project is to MAKE your very own Webmaker Agenda page. Add images, links and content to this page to create an Agenda and help others teach the web.
============================================================================ --><!--
Let's get started.

1) READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of this tag for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but instead is just text comments about the code. For this project, the comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding of what you are being asked to do.

2) GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

    <h2>KIJ13 Mozilla Webmaker Hackjam</h2>
    <h3><span class="subtitle">5 Hour Agenda</span></h3>
    <img src="http://stuff.webmaker.org/teach-assets/kits/images/greenbar.png">
    
    <h3>[10 mins] Introductions</h3>
    <p>Start by introducing yourself and explaining what YOU want them to learn. Include links to the workshop <a href="http://teach.etherpad.mozilla.org/kij13">etherpad</a> and explain that you're keeping that pad to stay connected, catalog links and share work.</p>
    <p>To keep introductions short, use a prompt that allows people to say a single unique thing. For example, <strong>"My name is, I work on/for/at, and if you really knew me, you'd know..."</strong></p>
    <p>A Facilitator has to be willing to make a fool out of him/herself, so choose a game to loosen people up and be animated in the way you  begin. People are self conscious, show them that you see everyone as 100% awesome. Try to remain positive the entire time. When you have "problem people" be firm, but nice, and remember you're the workshop leaders.</p>

    <h3>[20 mins] Spectrogram Icebreaker</h3>
    <p>The Spectrogram uses short, controversial or extreme statements to begin a discussion about the topics of the day.</p>
    <h4>How to spectrogram</h4>
    <p><strong>Place post its</strong> with numbers from one to ten written on them, in a line on the floor or wall. Leave enough space for people to separate along the line.</p>
    <p><strong>Explain the activity:</strong> You will read a statement, and if they completelt agree with that statement, they should stand near the number 10. If they completely disagree, they should stand near the number 1. Those who are unsure, or only half agree should stand at number 5. Tell the participants that they can change their minds based on what others say.</p>
    <p><strong>Read the first statement</strong> and once participants have divided themselves along the line, ask someone why they are standing where they are. <strong>Use the activity to begin discussion and debate on the essential themes of the day.</strong></p>
    <p>Allow learners to explore ideas during the activity. At the end, tie learners comments and ideas together with the key topics of the event.</p>

    <h3>[10 mins] Break into Groups</h3>
    <p>No one has to work alone. They will work in pairs, but with their peers at the table. Oh, sounds impossible? No, participants get to ask their neighbours to help them instead of raising their hand. This isn't primary school! Explain that you'll be floating and help people that get stuck. Tell people to work with those they don't know.</p>

    <h4>Persona and the Badge Backback</h4>
    <p>Get everyone to set up with <a href="http://login.persona.org">Persona</a> and their <a href="https://webmaker.org/login">Webmaker Space</a></p>

    <h3>[30 mins] MAKE - Getting to know the tools</h3>
    <p>Before they go diving into making their project having never used the tools before we're going to spend a little time getting to know how <a href="https://popcorn.webmaker.org/editor/">Popcorn Maker</a> and <a href="https://thimble.webmaker.org/">Thimble</a> work by remixing some of the starter makes available from <a href="https://webmaker.org/en-US/search?type=tags&q=webmaker:template">webmaker.org</a>.</p>
    <p>This will allow them to familiarise themesleves with the tools, as well as make some extra goodies to share with their friends and family after the hackjam.</p>
    <p>You float. Be sure to point people to additional resources, websites or cheatsheets! </p>

    <h3>[40 mins] Primary Make Introduction</h3>
    <p>Regroup after the last activity and <strong>explain to everyone what YOU want them to build.</strong> Explain why they've been getting footage all week, and what they should try and make, as well as the benefits to their troop.</p>

    <h4>[30 mins (of the 40)] Stickynote Storyboarding</h4>
    <p>Splitting back into pairs (this time in pairs from the same troop), explain that all great videos are planned a little before their made. Briefly describe the value of a storyboard, as well as what they should be putting into theirs.</p>
    <p>YOU will be floating, encouraging them to share their ideas with others at the table, and taking photos of their finished storyboards for later on.</p>
    <h5>Stickynote Storyboarding</h5>
    <p>Stickynote Storyboarding is almost identical to the regular kind, except more fun, more creative, and way more remixable. In place of the usual frames on the standard storyboard template. Notes about each frame can then be written under the stickynote instead of under.</p>

    <h3>[10 mins] Robot Dance</h3>
    <p>This is a great way to inject a little more energy into the group, and can be used to physically demonstrate what it means to hack.</p>
    <h4>How to do the robot dance</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Form a circle and practice a robot dance together. Keep it simple though.</li>
      <li>Now start hacking the dance. The first person in the cicle changes a step, then demonstrates the change.</li>
      <li>The person to the left dances the new step, and either hacks that step, or hacks another step.</li>
      <li>Repeat until everyone has danced. After the last person has made their hack, everyone practices the new dance together.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>[20 mins] Mesh Icebreaker</h3>
    <p>Time to warm up again, recap the morning, and re-introduce/remind what the primary make is all about.</p>
    <h4>How to Mesh</h4>
    <p>To setup the activity get all participants standing in a circle. Holding onto one end of the string/yarn, toss the ball to someone in the group and ask them a question about their morning/experience at KIJ13.</p>
    <p>Whomever catches the ball gives their answer to the question and then asks a new question. Then, the learner asks a new question and tosses the ball to someone new. The discussion continues until everyone has answered at least one question.</p>

    <h3>[1hr 30 mins] MAKE - Primary Make</h3>
    <!--Write up your own activity with the Hackable Activity Template! https://mozteach.makes.org/thimble/hackable-activity-template -->
    <p>Everyone splits into their (troop) pairs. A practical, project based activity allows learners to delve deeper into the essential questions of your session.</p>
    <!--This make session is about team work and composition. How do groups work out the design challenge? Advise that they can make multiple pages, but that they should set requirements and plan together. Each group plans, collects assets, builds.-->
    
    <h5>Break into pairs</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>In pairs, revisit the storyboards from earlier, and make any last changes.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Start Hacking</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Focus on the idea(s) that got the most traction, using the <strong>paper prototype storyboards</strong> as a reminder. This helps formulate final ideas and exposes any holes.</li>
      <li>There's no rush to finish this, however for those that finish quickly you can suggest ways to remix, and extend their make, or give them a sneeky peak at the next activity so they can start brainstorming ideas on how to complete that.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>[40 mins] BONUS: Thimble Hacking!</h3>
    <p><em>This can be skipped if people want to finish their popcorn makes.</em></p>
    <p>Working from the <a href="https://fuzzyfox.makes.org/thimble/KIJ13-makerparty-roundup/remix">premade template</a> people should roundup their day. They can include their popcorn makes, thimble projects they've worked on, and what they feel they've learned! As a bonus they could remix this project to express their thoughts, and experiences of KIJ13 as a whole!</p>
    <p>Once their Thimble make is complete they should share it out with their firends and family to let them know how much fun they've missed out on by not going to camp!</p>
    <p>You should float, provide... <em>you get the idea by now :P</em></p>

    <h3>[20 mins] A Strong Wind Blows</h3>
    <p>Help clarify topics covered, skills leaned and best moments, with this hack on the well known game of musical chairs.</p>
    <p>Thematic statements are introduced and learners for whom the statement is true, must find a new seat.</p>
    <h4>How to play</h4>
    <p>To setup the game, get all participants sitting in a circle with no empty chairs. The facilitator, who is standing, is the first to play. Tell the learners that the topic is the hackjam and the web. The facilitator makes the first statement. E.G.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>"A Strong wind blows for anyone who knows HTML syntax"</li>
      <li>"A Strong wind blows for anyone who knows what CSS stands for"</li>
      <li>"A Strong wind blows for anyone who thinks Wikipedia is always true"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As soon as the statement has been made, every person for whom the statement is true must jump out of their seat and find a new available seat. The person who made the statement is almost always able to grab a seat, which leaves a new person standing once all seats are filled. That person must then make a "strong wind blows" statement to continue the game.</p>
    <p>An additional rule is provided for amusement and chaos, as well as for anyone unable to fashion a "strong wind blows" statment: the person standing may yell "Hurricane!", which compels all participants to scramble for a new seat.</p>
    <p>When the session facilitator is ready for the game to close (after perhaps 10 - 15 minutes), they simply stand and refrain from grabbing a seat when other participants are changing position.</p>
    <h4>Bonus points</h4>
    <p>When playing this game at the end of the event, spend a few minutes at the end discussing the links between peoples responses now, to the icebreaker you ran at the begining.</p>


    <h3>[30 min] Closing Circle</h3>
    <p>Use the closing circle to <strong>celebrate</strong> what you made. Have participants present their prototypes and encourage them to think about what they want to do next with their project.</p>
    <p>If you like (and there is time/the ability to), share your prototypes with the world! You can publish the links and other materials to a blog or the social network of your choice.</p>
    <p><strong>Please tag your work with #makerparty</strong></p>
    <p>You may also want to ask questions like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What did you make?</li>
      <li>What did you learn?</li>
      <li>Do you have questions?</li>
      <li>How would you like to follow up?</li>
      <li>Were you excited?</li>
      <li>Did you have fun?</li>
      <li>What will you do next?</li>
      <li>How would you change this workshop?</li>
    </ul>
