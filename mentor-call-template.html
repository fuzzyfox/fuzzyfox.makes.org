  <!-- Hello! This is a remixable template to report out the Webmaker Mentor Team calls. Go team!-->

  <!-- This is where you put the title for your page (it helps your browser name tabs, etc.) -->
  <title>Webmaker Mentor Team Call report-out (4 December 2013)</title>
  <meta charset="utf-8">

  <!--
    This is where the interesting stuff happens - the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). You can style each element that you've defined above. 

    It's all pretty self-explanatory and, because you've got a preview window to the left and an undo button above, it's worth just tinkering around until you get what you want.

    One final thing: if you click on an element (e.g. "iframe") a yellow question mark will pop up. Click on that and it'll take you to the Mozilla Developer Network where you can find out more about that element.

    Have fun!

      <h3>TL;DR</h3>
      <p>This week our main focus was on next week's <a href="http://csedweek.org/">Hour of Code</a>. We also welcomed the multi-talented <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/atul/">Atul Varma</a> to the team and talked about workflows in various forms.</p>
    </section>

      <h3>Obstacles overcome in 2013</h3>
      <p>As a warm-up while people joined the call, we listed our 'favourite obstacle overcome in 2013'. These included:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Expanding from 19 to 40 members of Hive Toronto <em>(<a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/kathryn/">Kathryn</a>)</em></li>
        <li>Learning Mozilla jargon within a month <em>(<a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/elsa/">Elsa</a>)</em></li>
        <li>Federating the Mozfest program so that Space Wranglers had complete programmatic control of the sessions, space design and facilitators for their tracks. <em>(<a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/thornet/">Michelle</a>)</em> </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Everyone laughed with Elsa thinking that she'd now 'got' Mozilla jargon after only a month. Many of us are still learning several years in...</p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p><a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/CLAW/">Chris</a> kicked things off by explaining that it's there's a meeting of the Mozilla Board today after which we'll have more clarity about funding and structure going forward for 2014. As a result, we'll have a 1.5 hour meeting next week to really dig into our <a href="https://teach.etherpad.mozilla.org/yourgoals">individual and team goals</a>.</p>

      <p>To some people's surprise, but to everyone's delight, <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/atul/">Atul</a> was unveiled as the newest transfer to the Webmaker Mentor Team. Cue much celebration on the etherpad:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <span style="background-color:#FFF8E3"><strong>Welcome Atul:</strong> Atul is joining the mentor team as our prototyping wizard in residence</span> <span style="background-color:#C78FFF">Yay!!!!</span> <span style="background-color:#8FFFFF">+1</span><span style="background-color:#FFC7C7">+1mmmm :-D</span><span style="background-color:#FF8F8F">woohoo!</span> <span style="background-color:#ECBCE0">OMG!

      </blockquote>

      <p>Atul has produced many demos, some of which you can see on the <a href="https://teach.etherpad.mozilla.org/mentorcall3">pad</a>. He expressed an interest in interfacing with users - either via videoconference or in person in the NYC area. <strong>Welcome Atul!</strong></p>

      <h3>Hour of Code</h3>
      <p>Next week it's the official kick-off of the <a href="http://csedweek.org/">Hour of Code</a> which Mozilla is involved with. <a href="">Lainie</a> shared a <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/LDeCoursy/">draft blog post</a> about our involvement and shared some things we can be doing:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tweet</strong> links to Webmaker projects with the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23hourofcode&src=typd">#hourofcode</a></li>
        <li><strong>File bugs</strong> from the tutorials on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=Webmaker%20tutorials&list_id=8777486">BugZilla</a></li>
        <li><strong>Get involved</strong> in a Connected Learning webinar <em>this</em> Thursday preparing for Hour of Code (features <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/dajbelshaw/">Doug</a>)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/HiveToronto">Hive Toronto</a> and <a href="http://www.hivechicago.org/">Hive Chicago</a> shared what they're up to with the Hour of Code - namely working with their networks to use Webmaker and other tools to teach young people some JavaScript.</p>
      
      <p>It's also worth noting that there's a new 'tutorial' feature in Thimble that adds an additional pane to the left of the window with some explanatory text. <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/LauraHilliger/">Laura</a> has written a <a href="https://laura.makes.org/thimble/how-to-write-a-webmaker-tutorial">great guide</a> on how to get started with this!</p>

      <h3>Open position: Documentation &amp; Design Coordinator</h3>
      <p><a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/willbarkis/">Will</a> shared an open position for a <a href="https://careers.mozilla.org/en-US/position/obX7XfwW">Documentation &amp; Design Coordinator</a> for the Hive Gigabit Community Fund. He encouraged us to suggest people who might be interested and to contact him with networks who might be able to advertise the position more widely.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>help@webmaker.org</h3>
      <p><a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/LauraHilliger/">Laura</a> raised a new problem we have now that a couple of people have left Mozilla - namely that no-one is currently responsible for responding to 'help' emails from the community.</p>
      
      <p>After some conversation, <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/amiradhalla/">Amira</a> volunteered to follow this up by digging out a workflow used previously and get together a plan that she will share back to the team at a later date.</p>

      <h3>Productivity call</h3>
      <p>After some great chat on the etherpad during last week's call there was an appetite for a separate productivity-themed call. <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/dajbelshaw/">Doug</a> got in touch with those interested and a date/time has been set:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Date:</strong> Tuesday, 10th December 2013</li>
        <li><strong>Time:</strong> 8am PT / 11am ET / 4pm GMT / 5pm CET</li>
        <li><strong>Location:</strong> Vidyo (<a href="https://v.mozilla.com/flex.html?roomdirect.html&key=BQJuiBAlxEuV">Doug's room</a>)</li>
        <li><strong>Etherpad:</strong> <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/productivity">https://etherpad.mozilla.org/productivity</a> (including some fun 'homework') </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Everyone welcome!</p>
      
      <p>The conversation that followed got us onto documenting the 'tacit' knowledge within Mozilla. We flagged using the Foundation wiki and the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org">Mozilla wiki</a> more effectively as something to explore.</p>

      <h3>Webmaker Mentors community call</h3>
      <p><a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/thornet/">Michelle</a> and <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/LauraHilliger/">Laura</a> encouraged the team to attend the upcoming Mozilla Webmaker Mentors community calls, explaining that 30-40 mentors usually show up:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>This week:</strong> Thursday, 5th December: 10am ET / 3pm UTC</li>
        <li><strong>Next week:</strong> Thursday, 19th December: 10am ET / 3pm UTC</li>
        <li><strong>Agenda:</strong> <a href="https://teach.etherpad.mozilla.org/mentors-thursday2">https://teach.etherpad.mozilla.org/mentors-thursday2</a></li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>For bonus points, they challenged us to dive into the agenda pad <em>before</em> the call to add some responses as people are already looking at it.</p>
      <p>Oh, and one more thing: (virtual) costumes are <em>required</em>!</p>

      <h3>Hive Chicago Member Guidelines, MOU Data Collection &amp; RFP</h3>
      <p><a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/omnignorant/">Robert</a> showed us <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-EZWDUirQ46amwyempjU2Ztd0E&usp=sharing">some documents</a> that <a href="http://www.hivechicago.org/">Hive Chicago</a> have recently shared with their network. "The goal is to characterize our membership and provide clarity to stakeholders on what Hive membership means," he says. </p>
