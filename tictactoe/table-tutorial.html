		<h1>TicTacToe</h1>
		<p style="font-size:smaller"><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Intermediate</p>
		<p>In this project we're going to go through the process of creating a simple game of TicTacToe with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
		<p>We'll use HTML and CSS to visualize the game, and JavaScript to control the logic (working out who wins / loses).</p>
		
      <p><em>Don't worry that the preview is blank right now... this is because we've got to write some code to make the game work. :)</em></p>
		<hr>

		<p>At the top of this tutorial section you'll see two buttons, use these to move forward and back through the tutorial.</p>
		<img alt="thimble-tutorial-pagination" src="//support.cdn.mozilla.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2013-10-25-06-53-50-ad11bd.png" style="box-shadow: 0 0 4px #444; display: block; margin:auto;">

		<h2>Game Preview</h2>
		<p>Lets take a quick peek at what we'll be making before we get started.</p>
		<iframe src="//fuzzyfox.makes.org/thimble/tictactoe-table-version_" frameborder="0" id="game-preview"></iframe>
		<p>What you end up with doesn't have to be exactly the same, this is just the simple example we came up with.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>Make it look right</h1>
		<p>Right now we have a little bit of the code we're going to need to make this game... but in the preview we can see that it just doesn't look like TicTacToe yet.</p>
		<p>On line 25 we can see that we have a table... why cant we see it though? Well at the moment none of the cells have any borders. So lets add some with CSS.</p>
		<p>Jump up to line 9 and you can see we've got a little CSS styling our cells. What happens if we give them a border?</p>
	
		<div class="code-hint">
			<a href="#code-hint-1">toggle hint</a>
			<code>
				<pre>border: 2px solid #444;</pre>
			</code>
		</div>

		<hr>

		<p>Remember how the preview looked? See if you can make your's look similar on line 16.</p>
		<p><small><em><strong>Hint:</strong> use <code>:first&#8209;child</code> and/or <code>:last&#8209;child</code> selectors.</em></small></p>
		<div class="code-hint">
			<a href="#cheat-1">CHEAT</a>
			<code>
				<pre>table#game tr:first-child td { border-top: none; }
table#game tr:last-child td { border-bottom: none; }
table#game tr td:first-child { border-left: none; }
table#game tr td:last-child { border-right: none; }</pre>
			</code>
		</div>

		<hr>

		<p>Lets make one more style tweak to make it easy for people to know which cell is going to be selected. How about a nice hover effect for each cell?</p>
		<p>In CSS this can be done with the <code>:hover</code> selector. Try doing this on line 20.</p>
		
		<div class="code-hint">
			<a href="#code-hint-2">toggle hint</a>
			<code>
				<pre>table#game td:hover {
  /* rules to style the cell 
     on hover go here */
}</pre>
			</code>
		</div>

		<p>In the example we changed the background color to a light grey.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h1>Making a move</h1>
		<p>So far we've used CSS to make the template code look a little more like like the game we know and love. Now we're going to start playing with some JavaScript to make this game work!</p>
		<p>Right now if you click on a cell nothing happens... lets change that. On line 82 we can see that we're checking if the cell is empty using <code>this.innerHTML</code>. We can change the value of <code>this.innerHTML</code> like we can change the value of variables. We also have a variable called player (line 49), that knowns what the current player is. So lets make <code>this.innerHTML</code> equal <code>player</code>.</p>

		<hr>
		
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> we're not going to dig into events in this tutorial, however its worth knowing that in this case <code>this</code> is a reference to the cell that the event listener on line 80 has been applied to.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>Take turns</h1>
		<p>Now we can click on cells in the game, and mark them with an X, but what about the other player? O?</p>
		<p>On line 54 there is a function called <code>change_player</code>. A function in its simplest form is just a block of code which does something, that we can reuse later by using its name. In this case the thing we want it to do is change the player, which we can see on line 49 has been set to <code>'X'</code>.</p>
		<p>There are only two players in TicTacToe, so we need to make this function change the player variable to <code>'O'</code> if it's <code>'X'</code>, and visa versa. We can do this with an <code>if(condition){} else {}</code> statement.</p>

		<div class="code-hint">
			<a href="#code-hint-3">toggle hint</a>
			<code>
				<pre>if(player == something) {
  player = somethingelse;
}
else {
  player = something;
}</pre>
			</code>
		</div>

		<hr>

		<p>Now this function is written we can make use of it in the rest of our code. Lets call it on line 115. You call a function like so:</p>
		<code>
			<pre>function_name();</pre>
		</code>
	</section>

	<section>
		<!-- write check_win() -->
		<h1>Starting to take shape</h1>
		<p>We should now have something that resembles the game we know and love. But there's a problem, it doesn't know when we win!</p>
		<p>We can start to fix this by taking a look at <code>check_win(cell)</code> on line 61. This function, as the comment above it indicates, should take an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming">array</a> of 3 cells. Just the right number to check a row, column, or diagonal for a winning streak!</p>
		<p>As with <code>change_player()</code> we can check that all three cells provided to us are the same using an <code>if(condition){}</code>statment. However there are 3 conditions we need to meet.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If cell 0 is the same as cell 1.<br> <small>Computers count from 0 not 1</small></li>
			<li>If cell 1 is the same as cell 2.<br> <small>If the first is true, and this is true, then we can assume all three are the same.</small></li>
			<li>If cell 0 is <strong>not</strong> empty.<br> <small>If the above are true, then we know their all empty by checking only one of them.</small></li>
		</ul>
		<p>If any of these conditions are not true we want to <code>return false;</code>, but if their all true we can <code>return true;</code>.</p>

		<hr>

		<p>You can get the contents of a cell <small>(within the <code>check_win(cell)</code> function)</small> by using:</p>

		<code><pre>cell[0].innerHTML</pre></code>

		<p><strong>Note:</strong> the code above is for the first cell of three.</p>

		<div class="code-hint">
			<a href="#cheat-2">CHEAT</a>
			<code>
				<pre>if(cell[0].innerHTML == cell[1].innerHTML){
  if(cell[1].innerHTML == cell[2].innerHTML){
    if(cell[0].innerHTML != ''){
      return true;
    }
  }
}
return false;</pre>
			</code>
		</div>
	</section>

	<section>
		<!-- write diagnoals, first in detail, second not so -->
		<h1>Almost done</h1>
		<p>We're almost done... the game now checks for a win in the rows and columns after each move... but it needs to two more directions. The diagonals.</p>
		<p>On line 88 and line 95 you can see that <code>check_win(cell)</code> is using some CSS code mixed in with the JavaScript. This method won't work for the diaganols, so we need to write some code that does this for us.</p>
		<p>We're going to do this by getting all the cells in the game, and picking just the ones we want as an array. Lets go through how to do this for the first diagonal, then its up to you to work out the second.</p>

		<hr>

		<p>First we need to get all the cells in the game.</p>

		<code>
			<pre>var cells = game.<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element.querySelectorAll">querySelectorAll</a>('td');</pre>
		</code>

		<p>Next we want to create a new array of some specific cells and return it... in this case the first <small>(top left)</small>, fith <small>(center)</small>, and last <small>(bottom right)</small>. <strong>Remember:</strong> computers start counting at 0, not 1.</p>

		<code>
			<pre>return [cells[6], cells[4], cells[2]];</pre>
		</code>

		<p>Now its your turn... try and complete <code>diagonal_up()</code> by yourself. (line 72)</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>It works! <small>Hopefully.</small></h1>
		<p><strong>That's it.</strong> We should now have a working game of TicTacToe. If yours doesn't work maybe try comparing your code to the <a href="https://fuzzyfox.makes.org/thimble/tictactoe-table-version/remix">completed version</a> and work out where there are differences.</p>

		<h2>Feeling ready for a challenge?</h2>
		<p>Right now there are some things that could be made better... if you're looking for a challenge see if you can fix these:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>There are some bits of repeating code that could become a function between line 86 and 112.</li>
			<li>It might be nice to know what the current player is before a move is made.</li>
			<li>Why not see if you can show the number of times each player wins?</li>
		</ul>
