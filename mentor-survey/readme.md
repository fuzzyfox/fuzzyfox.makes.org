## Webmaker Mentor Survey 2013 (Makes)

In 2013 I helped run a small survey of the [Webmaker Mentor Community](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/106022863174952221205). I took a slightly unique approach and first tried to gather information in a much more interesting maner than the usual form based method.

One part to this was to have people go through an make something using these starter makes. Some which have been updated and improved upon due to simplicity, reuse, and popularity.
