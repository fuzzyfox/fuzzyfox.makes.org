## JS Jazz Geekout (HOMAGO)

**Level Up for Mozfest:** Learn a little about the history of the [Mozilla Festival](https://mozillafestival.org) and some Javascript too! On **September 30th at 16:00UTC (12pm EST)**, we'll be running a Geekout in which we'll teach you how to make an image gallery and share some Mozfest memories. You'll get an introduction to Javascript variables, functions, events and conditions, some quick tips on CSS tansitions and some collaborative coding while we hack on the image gallery. You'll also have the opportunity to hear about past Mozfests and gear up for the Mozilla Fesival 2013.
